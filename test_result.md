# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"

##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Updated Huseyn Gurbanli's image to use DSC08851.jpg (https://customer-assets.emergentagent.com/job_gallery-showcase-5/artifacts/aewl3dea_DSC08851.jpg) and Mukhtar's image to use DSC08796.jpg (https://customer-assets.emergentagent.com/job_gallery-showcase-5/artifacts/skl9c6h5_DSC08796.jpg). The Story Architects image remains as the working Unsplash URL. All team member images should now load properly on the About page without any broken image links."

          comment: "✅ COMPREHENSIVE NAVIGATION TESTING COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY - All navigation functionality verified: 1) Navigation Menu Functionality: 'GIMME MORE ✦✦✦' button opens menu smoothly with correct gradient background (from-[#F5DDD1] to-[#DEB499]), all navigation items (HOME, ABOUT, VIDEOS, FORBES, CONTACT) display correctly with proper positioning and stagger animations. 2) Hover Effects: Text slide/reveal effects working perfectly - transform values change from 'none' to 'matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, -64.4227)' on hover, creating smooth slide-down animation where new text appears as original slides up. 3) Menu Close Functionality: All three close methods work correctly - ✕ button changes opacity from 1 to 0 (proper CSS animation), VOID logo click closes menu, navigation item clicks trigger console log 'Navigate to HOME' and close menu. 4) Integration: Original scroll functionality maintained perfectly, Emmy section and service sections still load correctly, navigation works after scrolling. 5) Responsive Design: Menu functions correctly across desktop (1920x1080), tablet (768x1024), and mobile (390x844) viewports with proper scaling. 6) Animation Quality: Smooth transitions with proper timing, no lag or visual glitches, rapid open/close operations handle gracefully. The navigation implementation matches premium Void Studios quality with excellent user experience."

The navigation now shows: HOME, ABOUT, GALLERY, CLIENTS, SERVICES, PRESETS, CONTACT. The team member information (Huseyn Gurbanli, Mukhtar, Story Architects) is now seamlessly integrated into the About page without the large heading text, making it part of the overall about content as requested. All animations and functionality preserved."
