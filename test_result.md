# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Changed the menuItems array to include the new navigation structure: HOME, TEAM, GALLERY, CLIENTS, SERVICES, PRESETS, CONTACT. Each menu item has been assigned appropriate paths (/home, /team, /gallery, /clients, /services, /presets, /contact). All existing animations, hover effects, and menu functionality have been preserved.

          comment: "✅ COMPREHENSIVE NAVIGATION MENU TESTING COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY - All 7 new navigation items (HOME, TEAM, GALLERY, CLIENTS, SERVICES, PRESETS, CONTACT) are properly displayed and functional. Testing Results: 1) Menu Opening: 'GIMME MORE ✦✦✦' button opens menu smoothly with proper gradient background animation. 2) Navigation Items: All 7 items found and displayed correctly with proper positioning and stagger animations. 3) Hover Effects: Text slide/reveal effects working perfectly - transform values change from 'none' to matrix transformations on hover, creating smooth slide-down animation where new text appears as original slides up. 4) Click Functionality: All navigation items are clickable, trigger console logs ('Navigate to HOME', 'Navigate to TEAM', 'Navigate to GALLERY'), and properly close the menu after click. 5) Menu Closing: All three close methods work correctly - ✕ button (opacity transitions from 1 to 0), logo click closes menu, navigation item clicks close menu. 6) Animations: Smooth opening/closing transitions with proper opacity changes (0 → 1 → 0), no lag or visual glitches. 7) Responsive Design: Menu functions correctly across desktop (1920x1080), tablet (768x1024 - 32px font), and mobile (390x844 - 24px font) viewports with proper scaling. The updated navigation implementation maintains premium Void Studios quality with excellent user experience and all requested menu items working flawlessly."
